---
# !! You must check/change the following items !!
# Databases: (change to the path of your hecatomb databases)
# Host: (change to the name of the directory containing your masked host database)
# Reads: (change to the location of your projects input reads)
# System: Memory: Change to the max amount of memory used by bbtools (likely your max system memory)

Paths:
  # The base database directory
  # You can install them using download_databases.snakefile 
 
  Databases: /mnt/data1/databases/hecatomb
  
  # The reads directory has your input fastq files
  # Note: All of your results will go into this directory

  Reads: /mnt/data1/databases/hecatomb/test_data/raw_data/subsampled_25000/
  
  # Where do you want the results stored?
  # Recommended that you make a specific based dir (e.g. heactomb_runs) followed by project specific (e.g. test_data) for all of your runs
  #This should not be a subdirectory to where your Reads are located!
  
  Results: /mnt/data3/shandley/hecatomb_runs/test_data
  
  # Host directory name
  # e.g. human, mouse, dog, etc.
  # Needs to be the name of the directory containing the masked reference
  # If your reference is not available post an issue on GitHub requesting it to be added

  Host: macaque

  # Temp is a temporary directory. By default we make 
  # subdirectories in here for each application

  Temp: .tmp

System:
  # How much memory you want to allocate to java (required for bbtools steps)
  
  # This is in gigabytes of memory (e.g 2GB would use 2, 128GB would use 128)
  
  Memory: 100
  
  # Number of threads to use
  
  Threads: 64

### Tuning parameters
### Advise not to change and keep default, but included here for fine-tuning to ones own dataset
### See documentation for each individual program for detailed explanation (ie. for QSCORE review the bbduk.sh manual)

QSCORE: 15 # Read quality trimming score (rule remove_low_quality in 00_preprocessing.smk)
MINLENGTH: 100 # Read minimum length (rule remove_low_quality in 00_preprocessing.smk)
ENTROPY: 0.5 # Read minimum entropy (rule remove_low_quality in 00_preprocessing.smk)
CLUSTERID: 0.97 # Linclust read clustering percent identity (rule cluster_similar_sequences: in 00_preprocessing.smk)
CONTIG_SIZE_THRESH: 500 # Minimum allowable contig size
